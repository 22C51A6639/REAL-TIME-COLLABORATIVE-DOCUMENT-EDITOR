##
As part of my internship at CodTech, I built a real-time collaborative document editor where multiple users can type and edit a document together at the same time. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend to create a clean and responsive user interface, and Node.js with Socket.IO on the backend to handle live updates. The content is synchronized in real-time, and I added features like auto-save, clear with undo, and connection status. Redis was used to manage shared text across multiple users, and the entire app runs smoothly with support for saving and restoring data, making it a complete collaborative writing tool.
